# Predictive Models and Classification Algorithms project

Challenge/Context: In this project, the challenge was to develop a predictive model to identify whether a customer would default on a loan payment based on historical financial data.

Action: Utilizing Python and libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, I preprocessed the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis, and implemented various classification algorithms including KNN, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression. Feature engineering techniques were employed to enhance model performance, and cross-validation was utilized to assess model robustness.

Result: The predictive models achieved high accuracy rates, with the Logistic Regression model outperforming others with an accuracy of 85%. By deploying the model, the company could proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted intervention strategies, thereby minimizing financial losses due to defaults.

Reflection: This project underscored the importance of feature selection, model evaluation, and interpretability in building effective predictive models. It also highlighted the potential impact of machine learning in mitigating financial risks and optimizing business operations.
