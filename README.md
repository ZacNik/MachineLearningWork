# March Madness Mastery: Building a 66% Accurate Tournament Winner Predictor

Challenge/Context: The objective of this project was to develop a classification model to predict the winner of the March Madness tournament based on historical performance data of college basketball teams.

Action: Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, I undertook several steps. Firstly, I preprocessed the dataset, which involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating a new binary target variable indicating whether a team won the tournament or not. Next, I conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable. After that, I implemented various classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression. Feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance model performance, and cross-validation was utilized to assess model robustness.

Result: The predictive models achieved promising accuracy rates, with Logistic Regression emerging as the top performer with an accuracy of 66%. By deploying this model, the aim was to predict which teams would win the tournament, thereby enabling proactive decision-making and strategic planning for the March Madness event.

Reflection: This project highlighted the significance of feature selection, model evaluation, and interpretability in building effective predictive models for sports tournaments. It underscored the potential of machine learning in sports analytics to forecast outcomes and aid decision-making processes. By leveraging these insights, stakeholders could optimize their strategies and increase the likelihood of success in predicting tournament winners.
